\arguments{
\item{depth}{Depths of observed ages (age control points)}

\item{obs_age}{Observed age at each depth (age control points)}

\item{obs_err}{Error associated with each observed age (1 standard error)}

\item{min_age}{The minimum age that the first modelled depth can be. Useful if
extrapolating above the shallowest age control point to e.g. the surface.
So set min_age to the year the core was collected. E.g. for a core collected
in 1990, with ages in years BP this would be -40 (present = 1950 by
convention). The default value is the current year in calendar age BP
(currently -71 for 2021).}

\item{top_depth}{The top and bottom depths of the desired
age-depth model. Must encompass the range of the data. Defaults to the
shallowest and deepest data points unless \code{pad_top_bottom = TRUE}}

\item{bottom_depth}{The top and bottom depths of the desired
age-depth model. Must encompass the range of the data. Defaults to the
shallowest and deepest data points unless \code{pad_top_bottom = TRUE}}

\item{pad_top_bottom}{logical, pad the length of the age-depth model by 5% on
each end}

\item{K}{K controls the number and structure of the hierarchically modelled
  down-core sections. It is specified as a vector, where each value indicates
  the number of new child sections for each parent section, e.g., c(10, 10,
  10) would specify 10 sections at the coarsest level, with 10 new sections
  at next finer level, giving a total of 1000 sections at the finest
  resolution.

  By default, the total number of sections at the finest level is set so that
  the resolution is approximately 1 cm per section, up to a total length of
  900 cm, above which the default remains 900 sections and a coarser
  resolution is used.

  The default hierarchical structure is chosen so that the number of
  hierarchical levels, and the number of new child sections per level, are
  approximately equal, e.g. c(5, 5, 5) for a total of 125 sections.}

\item{nu}{Degrees of freedom for the Student-t distributed error model.
Defaults to 6, which is equivalent to the default parameterisation of
t.a=3, t.b=4 in Bacon 2.2. Set to a high number to approximate a Gaussian
error model, (nu = 100 should do it).}

\item{acc_mean_prior}{Hyperparameter for the prior on the overall mean
accumulation rate for the record. Units are obs_age / depth. E.g. if depth
is in cm and age in years then the accumulation rate is in years/cm. The
overall mean accumulation rate is given a weak half-normal prior with mean
= 0, SD = 10 * acc_mean_prior. If left blank, acc_mean_prior is set to the
mean accumulation rate estimated by fitting a robust linear model using
\link[MASS]{rlm}.}

\item{acc_shape}{Hyperparameter for the shape of the priors on accumulation
rates. Defaults to 1.5 - as for Bacon 2.2.}

\item{scale_shape}{Scale the shape parameter according to the number of
hierarchical levels, to control the total variance of the alpha
innovations. This defaults to TRUE as of Hamstr verion 0.5.}

\item{mem_mean}{Hyperparameter: a parameter of the Beta prior distribution on
"memory", i.e. the autocorrelation parameter in the underlying AR1 model.
The prior on the correlation between layers is scaled according to the
thickness of the sediment sections in the highest resolution hierarchical
layer, *delta_c*, which is determined by the total length age-models and
the parameter vector *K*. mem_mean sets the mean value for *R* (defaults to
0.5), while *w* = R^(delta_c)}

\item{mem_strength}{Hyperparameter: sets the strength of the memory prior,
defaults to 10 as in Bacon >= 2.5.1}

\item{scale_R}{logical: Scale AR1 coefficient by delta_c (as in Bacon) or
not. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{inflate_errors}{logical: If set to TRUE, observation errors are
inflated so that data are consistent with a "Bacon-style" monotonic
age-depth model. This is an experimental feature under active development.
Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{infl_sigma_sd}{Hyperparameter: sets the standard deviation of the
half-normal prior on the mean of the additional error terms. Defaults to 10
times the mean observation error in obs_err.}

\item{infl_shape_shape}{Hyperparameters: parametrises the
gamma prior on the shape of the distribution of the additional error terms.
Default to 1, 1.}

\item{infl_shape_mean}{Hyperparameters: parametrises the
gamma prior on the shape of the distribution of the additional error terms.
Default to 1, 1.}
